>
> **tb**: This directory contains the testbench files for simulation in EDA tools;
>
> **sim**: This directory contains simulation batch files and scripts;
>
> **app:** This directory contains not only the source code of the RV32 compliance test program, but also other applications, where the example directory has the source code of the C language program examples;
>
> **tools**: This directory contains the GNU toolchain needed to compile assembly and C programs, the scripts required to convert binaries into mem format files for simulation, and the scripts for downloading programs through serial ports.
